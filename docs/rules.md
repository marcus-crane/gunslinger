# Business Rules

- Multiple sources can be active at the same time
    - ie; playing a game while listening to music
- We treat paused items as being stopped but if playback is picked up, we mark the same instance as playing again (ie; podcasts listened to in chunks)
- It is exceedingly rare that I would ever use two of the same media type at the same time ie; listen to two songs at once, play two games at once.
- Different media types have different "priority" ie; a game and a song, the game is the main focus so would be highlighted as the main item with music as a background thing.
- Support more than 2 sources but only surface highest priority two
- Could be interesting to surface paused items if only one item active / recent ie; paused podcast slowly progressing
